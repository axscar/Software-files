# ⚠️ Warning about modifying our software
While we don't mind a level of creativity when it comes to modifying software, you inherently agree that all changes done are not at all supported by us.<br><br>
We don't revoke warranty for certain products, claims while under a modified state will be rejected on the basis that the changes were done outside of our official channels which could've caused any of the stated issues. Resetting back to stock configuration will restore warranty status as long as the base was untouched.
<br><br>
If you are shipping these modifications under a software bundle, distro, or other means, please do not submit any bug reports to us until you:<br><br>
**A**) **Disable the modification**,<br>
**B**) **Bring the software back to stock/official configuration**,<br>
**C**) **Refrain from flaming any modification developer, including us if things break**.
<br><br>
We will not be held liable for any issues surrounding the use of modifications under any circumstances, especially for modifications that might carry risk such as executable code, stealing of credentials, etc, as our software was never intended for modifications and will not be monitored for it's safety.
<br><br>
You agree that our licenses for the software in question are intact. 
Such as our use of the GPLv2 (GPL as we define in our listing) license for this Software-files repository which grants a copy-left but freedom to use with attribution given.
